- 👋 Hi, I’m @MarcHoag (otherwise known as @AutonomousHoag)
- 🎙 You probably know me from my podcast (google "autonomous cars podcasts" and I should be your first organic result).
- 💻 I founded a venture-backed startup and spun out a few others, and currently sit on the advisory board of an SF-based teleops startup.
- 🧸 I'm a UCLA Econ grad with a solid background in advanced math, physics, and chemistry, and was even pre-med for a while.
- ⚖️ I'm a California-licensed attorney.
- 👀 I’m interested in everything from law to physics, autonomous cars/smartmobility to film, tech startups to climate change, writing, and everything in between.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning github to tie together my solid HTML, working CSS, and minimal JS frontend knowledge... really just for fun.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything in law; climate/energy; autonomous vehicles; front-end (HTML/CSS) dev.
- 💡 I just launched a daily newsletter summarizing the top news in climate change, clean energy, and AVs/EVs: https://futureperfect.news
