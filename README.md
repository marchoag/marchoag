👋 Hi, I’m @MarcHoag (otherwise known as @AutonomousHoag)

🎙 You probably know me from my podcast (google "autonomous cars podcasts" and I should be your first organic result).

⚖️ I'm a California-licensed tech startup attorney ([marchoaglaw.com](url);) focused on AI and helping EU founders expand to the US.

💻 I founded a venture-backed startup and spun out a few others, and currently sit on the advisory board of an SF-based teleops startup.

🧸 I'm a UCLA Econ grad with a solid background in advanced math, physics, and chemistry, and was even pre-med for a while.

👀 I’m interested in everything from law to physics, autonomous cars/smartmobility to film, tech startups to climate change, writing, and everything in between.

🌱 I’m currently learning github to tie together my solid HTML, working CSS, and minimal JS frontend knowledge... really just for fun.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything.
