👋 Hi, I’m @MarcHoag; you can learn more about me at ([Hoag Law.ai](https://hoaglaw.ai))

⚖️ I'm a California-licensed SaaS attorney focused on tech startups and AI.

💻 I founded a venture-backed startup and spun out a few others, and currently sit on the advisory board of an SF-based teleops startup.

🧸 I'm a UCLA Econ grad with a solid background in advanced math, physics, and chemistry, and was even pre-med for a while.

👀 I’m interested in everything from law to physics, autonomous cars/smartmobility to film, tech startups to climate change, writing, and everything in between.
