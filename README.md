- 👋 Hi, I’m @MarcHoag (otherwise known as @AutonomousHoag)
- 👀 I’m interested in everything from law to physics, cars to film, tech startups to climate change, writing, and everything in between.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning github to tie together my solid HTML, working CSS, and minimal JS frontend knowledge... really just for fun.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything in law; climate/energy; autonomous vehicles; front-end (HTML/CSS) dev
- 📫 How to reach me: Twitter @MarcHoag & @AutonomousHoag; [linkedin.com/in/marchoag](url); [medium.marchoag.com](url)
